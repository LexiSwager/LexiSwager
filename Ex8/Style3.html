	<h1>WUTHERING</h1>
	<h2>HEIGHTS</h2>



<p>1801&mdash;I have just returned from a visit to my landlord&ndash;the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with.  This is certainly a beautiful country!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect misanthropist&rsquo;s heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff?&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>A nod was the answer.</p>
