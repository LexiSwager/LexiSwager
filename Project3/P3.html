<p>The opulent, refined town of Newport Beach with it&rsquo;s 10 miles of waterfront along the Pacific Ocean, may be by the seaside but it is as far away from a budget bucket and spades brigade as can be. You&rsquo;ll find it in Orange County along the sparkling and highly manicured Californian Riviera just a short drive from John Wayne airport.</p>


<p>You&rsquo;ve probably guessed that the airport was named after the swaggering movie cowboy dubbed &ldquo;The Duke&rdquo; who lived and died here alongside other Hollywood greats.</p>

<p>Newport Beach still exudes some of that old-time Hollywood feeling, and one way to capture it is through the history of its past resident celebrity greats and their amazing waterside homes, is by Duffy boat.</p>
</div>
<h1>Must take a Duffy tour</h1>

<div class="first">

<p>The waterfront at Balboa village has a carnival style Amusement Area with its own colourful ferris wheel that marks out where you can pick up a Duffy boat to tour the harbour. These blue&ndash;topped open&ndash;sided boats are a quaint type of quiet bay or lake cruiser powered entirely by electricity and I can report, are great fun to manoeuvre.<p>

<p>Our guide, Carolyn Clark, pointed out the celebrity homes as we smoothly glided over the sun speckled harbour water: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Johne Wayne once lived,&rdquo; she said nodding her head to a surprislngly unpretentious house on the water&rsquo;s edge facing Balboa Island. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Shirley Temple lived &mdash; the house at the closest point to the Coast Guard Beach where the peninsula &lsquo;bends&rsquo;,&rdquo; adding that the child star was named the first &ldquo;Miss Newport Beach&rdquo; at the age of 13. The original house was torn down and replaced by a beautiful home made of stone, glass, and wood.</p>

<p>It was a long list of stars and anecdotes that included Michelle Pfeiffer, Candace Bergen, Chuck Norris, Jay Leno and Nicholas Cage who famously fled Newport after a break in.</p>

<h2>Must walk along Balboa Pier</h2>
<div class="second">
<p>Sun screen in hand, I headed for the Balboa Pier Beach and its beautiful sand dunes. It&rsquo;s easy and cheap to park close to the beach and you can of course pitch up and sunbathe but, you can also see views without getting sandy &mdash; as I did. The pier stretches 920 feet along the blue waters of the Pacific ocean. It&rsquo;s dotted with locals fishing for who-know-what mackerel I think.</p>

<p>Certainly I didn&rsquo;t see anything being caught during the couple of hours that it took me to saunter along its length. I nipped into Ruby&rsquo;s restaurant at the end of the pier for a cuppa and headed back again stopping to rest on the benches simply to look at the view and the beach lovers splashing around or surfing.</p>

<h3>Must shop at Fashion Island</h3>

<p>On dry land it&rsquo;s all about the shopping. For those with deep pockets, Fashion Island is pretty stylish with its collection of 200 high end shops such as Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale&rsquo;s, Urban Decay and Macy&rsquo;s &mdash; you get the picture. It&rsquo;s a pretty environment, fantastic designer shops with great views.</p>

<p>For a more quirky shopping experience I ventured through the streets along the town&rsquo;s coast even taking a ferry to Balboa Island to check out the scene comign back with jerky from the Balboa Nut Company and some T&ndash;shirt souvenirs from the slightly cramped and slightly chaotic Pier Shop. And some sunscreen.</p>


<h4>Must check out Crystal Cove State Park</h4>

<p>Crystal Cove is a hidden arc of beach just off the Pacific Coast Highway. It is famous for two things: The first is for having featured in &ldquo;Beaches&rdquo; Hollywood blockbuster starring Bette Midler. I cried while watching that film and standing close to the white-washed villa that featured in it, I could recall the emotional scene.</p>

<p>Secondly, the dozens of restored mid-century wooden cottages are hip as rentals and a walk along the beach gives snapshot of how Californian&rsquo;s used to live. Restoration is ongoing but there are plenty available for rent. It&rsquo;s inexpensive too starting at $35 a night. But it&rsquo;s also pretty booked up.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Beachomber cafe.</p>

<h5>Must eat</h5>

<p>Crystal cove is also known for its Beachcomber cafe and its totally scrumptious beignets -these puffy treats are similar but lighter than donuts. There&rsquo;s also a lovely menu of eggs as you like them served with rosemary roasted potatoes, fresh fruit or cottage cheese.</p>


<p>I was delighted to be offered a Mamosa which is champagne with a touch of orange juice and happily, the lattes are served in extra wide cups. This is such a lovely experience, I would have liked to return for dinner to watch the sunset while nibbling on their seafood.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind blowing the budget, the Fig and Olive in the Fashion Island is a stylish option. Front doors open up to a the sprawling creamy-hued 12,000 sqft space with wood floors and high wood beamed ceilings. It’s open-plan with several areas including an al fresco option on the patio, each with their own ambience but all dotted with olive trees. There&rsquo;s an impressive wall entirely filled with olive oils – there must be a hundred or so from several European countries. It evokes a Mediterranean resort style atmosphere. I go there a tad early and took up residence on a red-cushioned stool by the marble-topped bar to sup a cocktail first.</p>

<p>The dining experience begins with a taste of three extra virgin olive oils served with rosemary olive oil fougasse bread.</p>

<p>We started with Beef Carpaccio and the Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet alongside an assortment of Crostinis, and mains included a salmon dish and New Zealand Rack of Lamb. Every dish is either cooked or finished off in olive oil. Deserts include a Chocolate Obsession, Cheese Cake and Caramelized Apple Tart. The wine list has 30 wines from Italy, France and Spain and all are offered by the glass.</p>

<p>It was a less extravagant experience at Lido Bottle Works. It&rsquo;s located in the lovely Lido Marina Village. This casually stylish restaurant offers unusually flavoured burgers in bacon jam and crispy jidory chicken glazed in coconut lime aioli. It&rsquo;s an interesting food menu and its accompanied by an impressive beer menu.</p>

<p>The Oak Grill restaurant in Fashion Island Hotel offers the American classics in a light and airy restaurant which stretches outside to a plush and lush terrace.</p>
