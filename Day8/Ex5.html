	<h1> How to create a simple ladybug in illustrator</h1>
	<ol>
		<li> Open up Illustrator </li>
		<p> -On the top toolbar click on file and hit new. </p>
		<p> -There will be a variety of layouts that you can choose from, we are going to go to the Print section and create a Letter document </p>
		<p> -Once the document loads we are going to start our illustration </p>
		<li> Create a New Sublayer </li>
		<p> -This is so that all of your components will fall under one section </p>
		<p> -once this is done go over to the illustrator tools on the left-hand side<p>
			<li> select Ellipse Tool </li>
			<p> -The default shape will be a retangle -The tool is located under the text tool- </p>
				<p>-press and hold onto the rectangle tool until it gives you various shape options; click on the Ellipse tool </p>
				<p> -to create the shape, click onto your screen and drag the mouse inwards </p>

			<li> Create the Body </li>
				<p> -we want the shape to be centered in the layout and have a width of 296.5 and a height of 354.5 </p>
				<p> -Once the shape is made go to the color fill picker on the left hand side at the bottom of the tools.</p>
				<p> -We want the color #ed1c24 </p>

			<li> Create the head  </li>
			<p> -using the same technique as creating the body we are going to use the Ellispe tool again </p>
			<p> -Drag the tool to create a shape that is 210.6 pt wide and 128.8 pt high </p>
			<p> -Go over to the color picker and make the color black </p>
			<p> -to center the object, use the direct select tool -top right tool- and click on the shape, there will be a small square in the middle that tells you where the center of the shape is. Try to get X as close as 295 and Y to 279 as possible. 

				<li> Add Legs and Antenna </li>
				<p> -with your brush tool we will create the lines </p>
				<p> -set your color to black </p>
				<p> -Create three legs on each side by drawning them and then two antenna on the head </p>

				<li> Spots </li>
				<p> -lastly with the ellipse tool we will create spots </p>
				<p> -what makes ladybugs unique is the different pattern of spots they have on their back </p>
				<p> -So with that being said pick your favorite number or pattern and create small black spots on the back of your lady bug </p>
