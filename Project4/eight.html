  <h1>KODAK B-3 </h1>
  <div class="text1">  It was introduced by Kodak in 1903 and made until 1915. Variants were B, B2, B3, B4, B5, C and G. Early variants were expensive and had for example a combination of Kodak Automatic shutter and Rapid Rectilinear lens of Bausch & Lomb. Later moderately priced variants got the Ball Bearing Shutter. Both shutters were still for pneumatic remote operation or release by lever. A glass plate adapter was available for the camera. A later expensive variant had a Compound shutter with Zeiss Kodak Anastigmat.
