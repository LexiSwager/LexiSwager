  <h1>Kodak No.3 Brownie </h1> 
  <div class="text1"> The No.3 Brownie used 124 film and produced a very large negative perfect for contact printing. This camera was marketed with the idea of grabbing the business of vacationers. This demographic would flock to places like Coney Island, where photographers would photograph them and, at the end of the day, produce a "post-card" print. This is one of the Brownies that did that very same thing, cheaper with a bit longer waiting time for the print, of course.
