	You sprint away from the bonfire! Trying to get away from the monster, but you're running in the wrong direction. </p>

<p>A piercing howl erupts behind you just as a shooting pain goes through your back. He scratched you!! Tears well into your eyes making it hard to see where you are going.</p>

<p>Another wave of throbbing pain goes into your leg and you fall to the ground. You look down and see that the creature bit you. You feel like you’re going to die. What if the bite means you'll change into one too?</p>

 <p>Get up! It'll get you! </p>
<p>“Which ever happens” you think “please pick now and let it be over soon”.</p>
