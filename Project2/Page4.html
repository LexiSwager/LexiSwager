<p>“I swear it’s real!” Cries a boy who looks like he’s about to break down in tears. He can’t be older than ten years old. </p>

 <p>Another boy beside him (possibly brothers) is a lot calmer. “It’s true, I’ve hear it howling at night”.  His younger brother looks up at him graciously through tears. </p>

<p>“I don’t believe it”, remarks one of the campers. “I need proof!”</p>

<p>The eldest brother speaks again, “why don’t I tell you a story instead. The legend of the monster in Grover Camp”.
