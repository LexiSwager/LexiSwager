<p>You sprint towards the door and pull at the handle! It’s locked. Your trembling hands fumbled to try to get the door opened. </p>

<p>A piercing howl erupts behind you just as a shooting pain goes through your back. He scratched you!! Tears well into your eyes making it hard to see what you’re doing as you try to open the door. </p>

<p>“Time’s up”</p>

<p>Another wave of throbbing pain goes into your leg. You look down and see that the creature is biting you. You feel like you’re going to die. What if they are changing you into a monster too? </p>
<p>“Which ever happens” you think “please pick now and let it be over soon”.</p>
