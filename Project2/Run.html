<p>You sprint towards the door and pull at the handle! It&rsquo;s locked. Your trembling hands fumbled to try to get the door opened. </p>

<p>A piercing howl erupts behind you just as a shooting pain goes through your back. He scratched you!! Tears well into your eyes making it hard to see what you are doing as you try to open the door. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another wave of throbbing pain goes into your leg. You look down and see that the creature is biting you. You feel like you&rsquo;re going to die. What if they are changing you into a monster too? </p>
<p>&ldquo;Which ever happens&rdquo; you think &ldquo;please pick now and let it be over soon&rdquo;.</p>
