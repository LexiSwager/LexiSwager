<p>&ldquo;I think I&lsquo;ll go to the bonfire, it was really nice meeting you guys&rdquo; You leave the two brothers and never look back. </p>

<p>The bonfire is nice, you make causal conversation now and then. You wonder what would have happened if you stayed with the brothers and if there really is a &ldquo;werewolf&rdquo; in the woods.</p>

<p>The flames of the fire start dropping, soon to go out. 
Suddenly there is a rustling in the woods followed but a low growls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic!&rdquo;, yells a counselor, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably a bear that smelled our food. The best thing we can do is stay as a group and walk back to the cabins&rdquo;.

But you are so scared, you know its not really a bear! How can the counselor's tell you to keep calm? Should you run or stay in the group?
