<p>“I think I’ll go to the bonfire, it was really nice meeting you guys” You leave the two brothers and never look back. 

The bonfire is nice, you make causal conversation now and then. You wonder what would have happened if you stayed with the brothers and if there really is a “werewolf” in the woods.

The flames of the fire start dropping, soon to go out. 

Suddenly there is a rustling in the woods followed but a low growls.

“Don’t panic!”, yells a counselor, “it’s probably a bear that smelled our food. The best thing we can do is stay as a group and walk back to the cabins”.

You’re so scared, you know its not really a bear. Should you run or stay in the group?
