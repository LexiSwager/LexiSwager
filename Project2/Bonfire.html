<p>“I think I’ll go to the bonfire, it was really nice meeting you guys” You leave the two brothers and never look back. </p>

<p>The bonfire is nice, you make causal conversation now and then. You wonder what would have happened if you stayed with the brothers and if there really is a “werewolf” in the woods.</p>

<p>The flames of the fire start dropping, soon to go out. 
Suddenly there is a rustling in the woods followed but a low growls.</p>

<p>“Don’t panic!”, yells a counselor, “it’s probably a bear that smelled our food. The best thing we can do is stay as a group and walk back to the cabins”.

But you’re so scared, you know its not really a bear! How can the counselor's tell you to keep calm? Should you run or stay in the group?
