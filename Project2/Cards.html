<p>Tommy takes out a deck of cards and you all sit down and play for a while. It’s nice to finally feel welcomed some place and that you actually some friends at camp for once.  You’re having so much fun, laughing and telling stories, that you never really noticed the sun disappearing from the sky behind the curtains. </p> 

<p>“Well I think it’s about time”, Alex stands up and goes to the windows.</p>

<p>“Time for what?” you ask. </p>

<p>“The moon is finally out”, says Tommy, “now we can show you what we are talking about”.
“We’re going to change… and once again show that the story no one believed is actually true”.</p>

<p>In some odd twisted way, finally everything makes sense. The story they had told, the two Cedar sons.. that was them! “I don’t understand!” You cry out, “but how is this even possible, what are you going to do? Why me!?!”. </p>

<p>“Because you’re the only one dumb enough to trust strangers and come back to our cabin.” A sick machoistic smile spreads across Alex’s face. It morphs and changes. His eyes growing wider,  his face elongating into a snout, ears and teeth pointing. </p>

<p>The tearing and ripping sound of clothing and flesh comes from the boy’s bodies as they reject their human form. Hair forms everywhere. Snarls cut through the air.  “Now” rumbles a demonic voice from Tommy’s body, “I suggest you Run”.
