	<p> The whole week is outlined, it seems pretty fun! You even get to pick your activities most of the days!</p>
	<p> You’ll be given a choice between two options and pick whichever seems the best. Like now! You can either go down to the lake and kayak or do art’s and crafts. Which do you want to do?</p>
