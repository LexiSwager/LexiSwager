<p>Another bite and another bite. Soon the pain is unbearable and you pass out. 

You wake up, lying on the forest floor. How did you get there? 
The air smells crisp, the morning chill prickling the hair on your arm, on your legs, on your back, on your.. face. Youâ€™re hairy all over. 

You try to scream but all that you can make out is a long, piercing howl. 

THE END
