	<p> The cabin itself seems nice. It’s essentially bare except for four beds in each corner of the room. Cozy. Two beds have already been claimed by campers you haven’t met yet. Hopefully this year you’ll actually make friends and not end up with fire ants in your sheets again </p>
	<p> You place your bags down on the closest vacant bed and check your activity list on the cabin door </p>
