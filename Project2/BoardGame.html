<p>Tommy takes out a boardgame and you all sit down and play for a while. It&rsquo;s nice to finally feel welcomed some place and that you actually some friends at camp for once.  You&rsquo;re having so much fun, laughing and telling stories, that you never really noticed the sun disappearing from the sky behind the curtains. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I think it&rsquo;s about time&rdquo;, Alex stands up and goes to the windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time for what?&rdquo; you ask. </p>

<p>&ldquo;The moon is finally out&rdquo;, says Tommy, &ldquo;now we can show you what we are talking about&rdquo;.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to change.. and once again show that the story no one believed is actually true&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In some odd twisted way, finally everything makes sense. The story they had told, the two Cedar sons.. that was them! &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; You cry out, &ldquo;but how is this even possible, what are you going to do? Why me!?!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re the only one dumb enough to trust strangers and come back to our cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A sick machoistic smile spreads across Alex&rsquo;s face. It morphs and changes. His eyes growing wider,  his face elongating into a snout, ears and teeth pointing. </p>

<p>The tearing and ripping sound of clothing and flesh comes from the boy&rsquo;s bodies as they reject their human form. Hair forms everywhere. Snarls cut through the air. &ldquo;Now&rdquo; rumbles a demonic voice from Tommy&rsquo;s body, &ldquo;I suggest you Run&rdquo;.
