	<p> "Welcome to Grover Camp”, booms an overly cheery voice on the loud speaker ,”we are suuuupppeerrr excited for all you new campers out there! Check the door to your ASSIGNED cabin for a list suuupppeerr fun activities held today! Can’t wait to see you all at the bonfire tonight” </p>
<br></br>
<p> You uneagerly unload your bags out of the car. Either it’s the way that perky welcome sounded or the nerves of first day at camp; but something makes you want to throw up all the while you carry your bags to your assigned cabin: Good old number 13</p>
<br></br>
<p>Now, it’s not that I’m particularly superstitious, but 13 is a pretty unlucky number.. so I’d watch out if I were you.  </p>
<p>Go ahead into your cabin camper </p>
