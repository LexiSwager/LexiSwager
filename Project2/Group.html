<p>

You come to your senses and go back to the camp with the rest of your group, the monster in the forest never comes out. </p>

<p>You enter cabin 13 with rest of your campers and climb into bed, not before locking the door of course. The brotherâ€™s were right, the creature does only come out at night.  </p> <p>Pulling the covers over your head you say a little thanks for being safe.. tonight</p>
