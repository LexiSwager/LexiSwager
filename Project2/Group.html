<p>

You come to your senses and go back to the camp with the rest of your group, the monster in the forest never comes out. 

You enter cabin 13 with rest of your campers and climb into bed, not before locking the door of course. The brotherâ€™s were right, the creature does only come out at night.  Pulling the covers over your head you say a little thanks for being safe.. tonight

THE END
