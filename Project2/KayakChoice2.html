<p> There are already a ton of campers hanging out when you get there. But you’re shy and keep your head down as you walk by. You grab a paddle and a life jacket before heading to the kayaks.</p>
<p> Oh no! The kayaks are two seaters… and you don’t know anyone. So you just stand awkwardly at the shore,  listening to friends talk and laugh with each other…
