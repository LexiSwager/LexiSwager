<p>&ldquo;Long ago before Cedar Grove was a camp, it used to belong to the Cedar Family. They built their very own home on this land, the camp converted it into the headmasters cabin.
</p><p> The Cedars were a small family, just the parents and two sons. They lived on the land for a while, raising their children. Until one unfortunate Autumn. A pack of animals had been hunting nearby and got a hold of the boys.They were never seen again. 
</p><p>The story goes that the mother died of heart ache and the father was so furious that he went out to hunt the pack. The man was said to have killed every one of them except for the Alpha. And instead of the animal killing him he gave Mr. Cedar the worst fate ever. He bit him! 
</p><p>Mr. Cedar turned into part man part animal. And what animal was this? A WOLF! He was doomed to stay in this form forever. Some say he still lives in the very forest surrounding the camp. Every year he takes children he thinks are his son&rsquo;s. Hoping to finally find them.
